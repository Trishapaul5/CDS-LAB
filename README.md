Algorithm :

Step 1: Read the target element to be searched and the array to be searched in.

Step 2: Traverse the array elements using a loop or recursion.

Step 3: In each iteration/recursion call, compare the search element with the current array element.

Step 4: If the element matches, return the index of the corresponding array element.

Step 5: If the element does not match, move to the next element.

Step 6: If there is no match or the search element is not present in the given array, return âˆ’1
